What's up with the name?
------------------------

Coming up with proper names describing what the thing does that you're coding is quite hard... and since I'm not too creative, I thought I'd just mock the english language a bit by choosing a name that does not exist as such with a pronounciation close enough to existing words with the proper meanings => _Build + Yield_
